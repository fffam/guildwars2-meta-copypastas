## Verdant Brink

**Squad setup & Intro**

Hello! I'm setting up a squad for VERDANT BRINK tier 4 night-time meta. All welcome. Great way to get gear for new players (including Viper's stat condition gear). Check the LFG → Heart of Thorns → Verdant Brink

> [Character name]'s Verdant Brink meta — Tier 4
>
> ● Starts at xx:45
> ● SPLIT UP & defend all rally points!
> ● Defense events at 44:30, 24:30 and 24:30 remaining on timer
> ● Bosses at 20:00 on timer

This map is split into 5 different Outposts (orange icon on map). During daytime each outpost has its own chain of events to secure the local region.

During night-time, each Outpost will have 4 different RALLY POINTS. We have to defend the rally points for the first half of night-time, then...
... during the second half of night, we take choppers up to the canopy to kill 5 bosses (one per Outpost)

When night falls, we will have to CAPTURE, HOLD and LEVEL-UP 20 different rally points around the map (marked with small yellow icons).
We need to SPLIT UP, with 1-3 people defending each rally point.

**Night falls**

Open your map → find a rally point that doesn't have any defenders → Go there and defend it!
Max 2 people per rally point! The more rally points we successfully defend, the better chance we have of all getting max rewards!

**First defense phase 44:30**

Defense events are about to spawn!
Open your map → Find a yellow rally point icon → Go there and defend it!
Let us know if you need help at your rally point!

**First defense phase done**

Defense events done! Now we have 5 minutes to deliver supplies to our rally points, escort soldiers, and recapture any lost rally points.
The next defense event will be when the timer reads 34:30

Rally points defended! Now deliver supplies to them! Open your map, find any SOLDIER icons and escort them to the nearest rally point!
Open your map → Find a yellow SOLDIER icon → Get to the soldier quickly! →  Escort them back to a rally point

**Second defense phase 34:30**

Defense events are about to spawn!
The next defense event will be when the timer reads 24:30

**Third defense phase 24:30**

After this set of defense events, BOSSES will spawn in the canopy. Pact choppers will land at all safe rally points; Interact with the chopper then pick "Up to the canopy" to go fight the boss in your area!

Defense events are about to spawn!

After the next set of defense events finish, BOSSES will spawn in the canopy. Pact choppers will land at all safe rally points; Interact with the chopper then pick "Up to the canopy" to go fight the boss in your area!
After the next set of defense events finish, BOSSES will spawn in the canopy. We will be fighting them as a group, I will ping a waypoint after defense events finish!
Pact choppers will land at all safe rally points to take us up to the bosses. Follow the group, talk to the chopper and pick the first option.

**Bosses**

BOSSES HAVE SPAWNED! We will be doing the bosses as a big group. Our first boss will be:
BOSSES HAVE SPAWNED! Interact with the Pact Chopper at your nearest rally point to go and fight the boss. The bosses are:

[&BAgIAAA=] — Wyvern Matriarch (Will die quickly!)
[&BNUHAAA=] — Mordrem Tetrad (Bouncing mushroom mastery required)
[&BO8HAAA=] — Axemaster (Nuhoch Stealth Detection Mastery extremely useful!)
Get ready to use your CC (Defiance break) skills after he teleports (so we don't get insta-killed)
Knockbacks, fears, knockdowns, push, pull/etc will all break the defiance bar. Check your skill tooltips for "Defiance break" effect.
[&BOAHAAA=] — Frogs 
[&BN4HAAA=] or [&BAEIAAA=] — Wyvern Patriarch (Gliding updraft mastery required)

**After bosses are dead**

Do not leave the map until the end of night!
We got to Level 4, so once night-time ends, everyone with 150% map participation will get [&AgEvJQEA]
[&AgEvJQEA] is one of the few ways to get the Vipers stat Bladed chest piece (which is meta for a lot of condition damage builds)

**Meta complete**

The next Heart of Thorns meta is in Auric Basin [&BAYIAAA=] in 10 minutes!

## Gyala Delve

After this, we will be going to the new meta (Gyala Delve). You will need a Jade Bot core, and Shrimpling fishing bait (buy it at [&BMYMAAA=])
NEXT META: [&BKoNAAA=] Delve into the Haze (Gyala Delve) — IMPORTANT: If you do not have [&AgE/eAEA] fishing bait then go buy it at [&BMYMAAA=]
PSA: Fishing with [&AgE/eAEA] bait at [&BKgNAAA=] has an extremely high chance for legendary fish (worth 1.8g each). Make sure you have Shrimplings (from fishing vendor at [&BMYMAAA=]) before meta

## Drizzlewood Coast

NEXT META: [&BGQMAAA=] Drizzlewood Coast

Tips to make the most of your time in Drizzlewood:
1) You can travel around the map quickly by clicking on any blue sector marker on the map to airdrop at that location (or red icons too if theres a fight there)
2) At south meta, try to get 150% participation as quickly as possible (better chest rewards at the evaluation tick)
3) Buy 5 of each of the intel documents (e.g. [&AgE7bQEA]) from the trading post to unlock all of the Special Mission achievements for faster loot & masteries.
4) Buy 10-20 cache keys at the Quaestor NPC at Umbral Grotto (Consider parking an alt character and buying them daily)
5) For north meta, get the Olaf Olafson's Secret and Treasure Sleuth achievements done asap, for better chest loot and start progress towards infusion.

After we kill the copter, cache keepers will start spawning; it will be going FAST, grab your chests quickly then airdrop to the first keeper
CACHE KEEPERS NOW - Get your chests quickly then airdrop to the first cache keeper by clicking the nearest blue sector icon on the map
